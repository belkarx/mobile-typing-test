# mobile-typing-test
Test that gives scaled (by accuracy) words-per-minute when typing on a mobile device

## Motivation
The other online typing tests targetted towards mobile users sucked or just straight up didn't work, so I made my own

# Usage
Hosted at https://belkarx.github.io/mobile-typing-test/

## Features
- Usable on mobile devices
- Choose your own wordlist (find it on the internet, run it through an included parser, and alter ```words.js```
